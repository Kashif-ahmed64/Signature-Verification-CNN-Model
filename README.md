# Signature-Verification-CNN-Model
Implemented multiple deep learning models (CNN, Siamese NN, Convolutional Siamese NN) to classify and compare real vs forged handwritten signatures. Applied Euclidean distance-based similarity learning for one-shot verification. Applications include fraud detection, biometric authentication, and document security.
