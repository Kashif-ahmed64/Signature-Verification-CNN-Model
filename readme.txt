 Signature Verification using Deep Learning

This project implements different deep learning architectures for offline handwritten signature verification.   
It explores both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Siamese Networks to classify and compare real vs forged signatures. 

 
🔎 Project Overview
Signature verification is a crucial task in biometric authentication and fraud detection.   
This project compares multiple approaches:
1. CNN-based Classifier – Directly classifies a signature as real or forged. 
2. Siamese Neural Network – Learns similarity between pairs of signatures. 
3. Convolutional Siamese Network Combines convolutional layers with Siamese architecture for robust feature extraction.
